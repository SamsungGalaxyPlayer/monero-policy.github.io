#### What is the Monero Policy Work Group?

The Monero Policy Working Group (MPWG) is a loosely formed quorum of individuals that contribute to the [Monero open-source project](https://github.com/monero-project). The goal of MPWG is to work with regulators, policy makers, and the wider financial services sector to ensure broad understanding of Monero, and other privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, is communicated.
